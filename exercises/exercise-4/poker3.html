            <b>Introduction to Variants:</b>
            While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games. Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Omaha Hold'em</b>
                Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form their hand.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Seven Card Stud</b>
                Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card dealt.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Five Card Draw</b>
                Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Razz:</b>
                A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple:</b>
                Variants of Hold'em where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card must be discarded after the flop.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Stud High-Low</b>
                A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <b>Conclusion:</b>
            Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and psychology that offers endless excitement and opportunities for improvement.
